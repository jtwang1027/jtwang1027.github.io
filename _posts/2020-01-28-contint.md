In continuous delivery, code changes in the underlying pipeline can immediately trigger changes and updates to a running application. Google app engine  was used to build and deploy a web app. After, I tested the ability to make changes to the app file (main.py) and have these updates trigger and redploy an  updated web app. The purpose of the web application is to allow users to input a symptom for a condition or disease they are interested in, and the application will give a diagnosis and return a list of possible causes.

Google's App Engine was used to build and deploy a web application using the key files:

-*main.py* : primary Flask application 
-*app.yaml* :  specifies the python runtime
-*requirements.txt* : additional packages that need to be installed
-*cleaned.csv* : contains symptoms and diagnosis data. This was pulled from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/plarmuseau/sdsort). 
-*cloudbuild.yaml* : builds the application

To see a demo of this web app, view the demo mp4 video.[(link)](https://github.com/jtwang1027/contint)

Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/dataoptimal)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg" alt="linearly separable data">

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/perceptron/linsep.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
