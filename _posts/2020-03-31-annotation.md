## Background and Objective
scRNA-Seq data was generated from 8 high-grade glioma tumor patients (Yuan et al., 2018) [paper](https://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-018-0567-9). In this study, datasets were explored separately, and the findings were pooled for a unified conclusion. Here, we will integrate the datasets, accounting for batch effects, and use information from the combined dataset to identify cell types and markers & differentially enriched gene sets.

## Types of batch normalization

### Linear models
### Mutual nearest neighbors (Haghverdi, 2018)

### Seurat Anchors (Stuart,2019)
